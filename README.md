# Apziva - P3 -- Potential Talents

This project is to find talented individuals for sourcing these candidates to technology companies. Finding talented candidates is not easy, for several reasons. The first reason is one needs to understand what the role is very well to fill in that spot, this requires understanding the clientâ€™s needs and what they are looking for in a potential candidate. The second reason is one needs to understand what makes a candidate shine for the role we are in search for. Third, where to find talented individuals is another challenge.

The nature of HR job requires a lot of human labor and is full of manual operations. Towards automating this process we want to build a better approach that could save us time and finally help us spot potential candidates that could fit the roles we are in search for. Moreover, going beyond that for a specific role we want to fill in we are interested in developing a machine learning powered pipeline that could spot talented individuals, and rank them based on their fitness.

The main goal is to predict how fit the candidate is based on their available information (variable fit), rank candidates based on a fitness score, then Re-rank candidates when a candidate is starred.

So Using machine learning and NLP to acheive the goal of this project.

This code is written using Python3 on Google Colab.
